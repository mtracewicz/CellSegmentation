# Cell Segmentation using Tensorflow and Keras [![mtracewicz](https://circleci.com/gh/mtracewicz/CellSegmentation.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/mtracewicz/CellSegmentation)
This repository contains my implementation of U-Net neural network in Keras. Its puropse is to perfor segmentation of cells in microscopic images.
